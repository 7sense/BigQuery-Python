BigQuery-Python
===============

Simple Python client for interacting with Google BigQuery.

This client provides an API for retrieving BigQuery data by wrapping Google's low-level API client library. It also provides facilities that make it convenient to access data that is tied to an App Engine appspot, such as request logs.
